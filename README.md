# Hello there, I'm Petteri Kautonen 👋
<br />
I'm currently a full stack developer (at Work) with previous background in native desktop software. Open source is my hobby and passion. I'm quite inspiration-driven so I can create few repositories in a month or be silent for six to N months - as this is an artform and that runs on inspiration. I have been programming since -89 when I got my first 286 PC 🙂


My current interest is cross platform Desktop software with HTML/JavaScript UI and some local backend. The best in my opinion I've found to this far is [Tauri](https://tauri.app).

## My toolchain
* Web, TypeScript and React: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Linting: [Biome](https://biomejs.dev)
* C# development: [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
* Rust: [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - I haven't decided yet which I prefer more ⚖️
* AI: [Codeium](https://codeium.com), because it offers a free license for individual use, so for OSS development it is a good option 👍
